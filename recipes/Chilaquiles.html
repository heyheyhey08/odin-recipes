        <h3><em>Steps to make your own Green Chilaquiles!</em></h3>
        <p>To bake, do the following</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Take advantage of leftover tortillas. Use the tortillas that you have left over from the week as these turn out to be crispier than freshly made tortillas when frying them.</li>
            <li>Cut them into small triangles or strips. There are two ways you can make them crispy. Baked or fried in oil. </li>
            <li>Brush the corn tortillas triangles with olive oil (use 2 Tbsp or as much as needed) and place on a cookie sheet in a single layer. </li> 
            <li>Sprinkle with kosher salt.</li> 
            <li>Bake for about 12 to 15 minutes or until slightly brown and crispy. Set aside.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Or you can Fry them:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Fried: it is important that you fry them perfectly in preheated vegetable oil and cover them with oil, to achieve this you can fry them in small batches so that the oil in the pan covers the tortilla completely. When theyâ€™re fried to a golden crisp place them on a rack or on absorbent paper to release excess oil while the sauce is being prepared</li>
                <li>Meanwhile, add the 2 cups of Salsa Verde in a medium pan and simmer until hot.</li>
                <li>Add the crispy tortilla chips to the pan with the Salsa Verde and fold until all of the tortillas are covered.</li>
                <li>Serve immediately while the tortillas are crispy and the sauce is hot. </li>
            </li>
        </ol>
